"""Initialization of the ZenML Secret module.

A ZenML Secret is a grouping of key-value pairs. These are accessed and
administered via the ZenML Secret Manager (a stack component).

Secrets are distinguished by having different schemas. An AWS SecretSchema, for
example, has key-value pairs for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
as well as an optional `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`. If you don't specify a schema at the
point of registration, ZenML will set the schema as `ArbitrarySecretSchema`, a
kind of default schema where things that aren't attached to a grouping can be
stored.
